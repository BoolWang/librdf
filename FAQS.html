<h1 align="center">Redland RDF Application Framework - Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h1>


<ol>

<li>What is the license?

<p>Redland is
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free Software</a>,
or
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source</a> if you prefer.
</p>
</li>

<li>Why is the code released under two licenses - LGPL and MPL?

<p>I originally considered just a GPL version of the library but I
considered this too restrictive, hence the LGPL version.  LGPL also
allows the user, at their choice, to license the software under the
GPL (See LGPL Term 3) in which case this software can also be used
with all the other GPLed code -- see next answer.</p>

<p>As an alternative, the entire library can be used under the terms
of the 
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html">Mozilla Public License V1.1</a>
which allow you use it in other ways that aren't so <em>virus-y</em> (ahem)
as the (L)GPL.</p>
</li>

<li>Can I link this library with code under license XXX?

<p>Firstly,  
<a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/IANAL.html">IANAL</a>
however here is an overview of how you can use this software:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you choose the LGPL/GPL licenses, the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html">GNU project list of licenses page</a> says that you can link the following licensed software with the code:<br />
GPLed, LGPLed, X11, original BSD, modified BSD, Perl (as GPL), zlib<br />
and <b>not</b> these types:<br />
Apache, Zope, IBM, LaTeX (LPPL), MPL, NOSL, Sun PL, NPL, QPL, Artistic, APPL, Sun CSL, Plan 9<br />
check the link above for updates, since the above is not a definitive
list.</li>

<li>If you choose the MPL, you should be able to
link with most anything else except you might have problems
distributing stuff which includes GPLed/LGPLed parts, in which case,
choose the LGPL or GPL licenses.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Why is Redland written in C?

<p>Writing in C allows reuse in lots of ways and the library should
be easy to call from languages since most of them allow importing of
C libraries or calling of C functions.</p>

<p>C is also more "portable" (subject to the usual C problems) and
should be compilable on many different systems.  I have access to
Linux 2.2.x, Solaris 2.5 (Sparc), Solaris 7 (Sparc) and HP-UX 10 and
it configured, built and tested out of the box on all of these.</p>

<p>See also the W3C Library note on
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Library/User/Style/Cpp.html">C++ in C</a>
which covers some of these issues, although I wrote the library before
finding this.</p>
</li>

<li>Why is it called Redland?

<p>Well, librdf was too boring <tt>:-)</tt>!  I work for
the <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/">University of Bristol</a>
and <em>Redland</em> is an area of Bristol which has an 'R' and a 'D'
in the name.  Plus I couldn't find a decent word with the letters 'RDF'
in it.</p>
</li>
