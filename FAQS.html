<UL>

<LI>What is the license?

<P>librdf is
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</A>,
or
<A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source</A> if you prefer.

<LI>Why is the code released under two licenses - LGPL and BSD?

<P>I originally considered just a GPL version of the library but I
considered this too restrictive, hence the LGPL version.  LGPL also
allows the user, at their choice, to license the software under the
GPL (See LGPL Term 3) in which case this software can also be used
with all the other GPLed code -- see next answer.

<P>As an alternative, the entire library can be used under the terms
of the 
<A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.html">modified BSD</A>
style license which allow you use it in whatever way you
like as long as you don't pretend you wrote it, or use the authors
name to promote it.

<LI>Can I link this library with code under license XXX?

<P>Firstly,  
<A HREF="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/IANAL.html">IANAL</A>
however I here is an overview of how you can use this software:
<UL>
<LI>If you choose the LGPL/GPL licenses, the <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html">GNU project list of licenses page</A> says that you can link the following licensed software with the code:<BR>
GPLed, LGPLed, X11, original BSD, modified BSD, Perl (as GPL), zlib<BR>
and <B>not</B> these types:<BR>
Apache, Zope, IBM, LaTeX (LPPL), MPL, NOSL, Sun PL, NPL, QPL, Artistic, APPL, Sun CSL, Plan 9<BR>
check the link above for updates, this is probably not a definite
list.

<LI>If you choose the modified BSD license, you should be able to
link with most anything else except you might have problems
distributing stuff which includes GPLed/LGPLed parts, in which case,
choose the LGPL or GPL licenses.
</UL>


<LI>Why is librdf written in C?

<P>Writing in C to allow reuse in many ways and can be used in many
languages since most of them allow importing of C libraries or
calling of C functions.
